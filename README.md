# Project Name: Isochrone Algorithm for OpenStreetMap and Google Maps

## Overview
This project implements an isochrone algorithm for OpenStreetMap and Google Maps. An isochrone is a line connecting points that have the same travel time from a given origin. By using this algorithm, you can generate isochrone maps that visualize areas that can be reached within a certain time frame, helping in understanding accessibility, transportation planning, and other spatial analysis tasks.

## Features
- Calculates isochrones based on travel time from a specified origin point.
- Supports both OpenStreetMap and Google Maps as base maps.
- Customizable parameters such as travel mode (e.g., driving, walking, or biking) and time intervals.
- Provides visualization of isochrones on the map.
- Enables exporting isochrone data for further analysis or visualization.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Obtain API keys for the desired mapping services (OpenStreetMap and/or Google Maps).
3. Configure the API keys in the appropriate configuration files.
4. Run the application and specify the origin point and desired parameters.
5. View the generated isochrone on the map interface.

## Importance and Future Development
This project is of significant importance in various fields such as transportation planning, urban development, and location-based services. It provides a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing travel time and accessibility patterns. 

In the future, the project can be extended by adding additional features, such as:
- Support for more mapping services or data sources.
- Integration with other spatial analysis algorithms, like routing or service area analysis.
- Optimization and performance improvements for large-scale isochrone generation.
- Enhanced visualization options, including heatmaps or overlays of other geospatial data.
